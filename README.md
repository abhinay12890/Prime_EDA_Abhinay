# Amazon Prime Video EDA Project

## Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Amazon Prime Video dataset to uncover valuable insights about content diversity, regional distribution, trends over time, and audience interests. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to Amazon Prime Video and other streaming services for optimizing content acquisition, enhancing user satisfaction, and maximizing subscription growth.
